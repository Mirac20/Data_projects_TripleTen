## Project description

As an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on their website every day. I need to study the data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.


## Description of the data

- `price` - price of the vehicle
- `model_year` - model year of the vehicle
- `model` - type of model
- `condition` - condition of the vehicle
- `cylinders` - number of cylinders
- `fuel` — gas, diesel, etc.
- `odometer` — the vehicle's mileage when the ad was published
- `transmission` - type of transmission
- `paint_color` - color of the vehicle
- `is_4wd` — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)
- `date_posted` — the date the ad was published
- `days_listed` — from publication to removal
