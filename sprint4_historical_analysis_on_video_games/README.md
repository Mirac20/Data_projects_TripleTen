## Project description

This project is done for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
The data we have dates up to 2016. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.

## Description of the data

- `Name` - Name of the game
- `Platform` - Platform game was developed for
- `Year_of_Release` - Year game was released
- `Genre` - Category
- `NA_sales` - (North American sales in USD million)
- `EU_sales` - (sales in Europe in USD million)
- `JP_sales` - (sales in Japan in USD million)
- `Other_sales` - (sales in other countries in USD million)
- `Critic_Score` - (maximum of 100)
- `User_Score` - (maximum of 10)
 -`Rating` - (ESRB)

## Questions to be answered:

- Look at how many games were released in different years. Is the data for every period significant?
- How long does it generally take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?
- Which platforms are leading in sales? Which ones are growing or shrinking? 
- Building a box plot for the global sales of all games, broken down by platform. Are the differences in sales significant? What about average sales on various platforms?
- Take a look at the general distribution of games by genre. What can we say about the most profitable genres? Can you generalize about genres with high and low sales?
