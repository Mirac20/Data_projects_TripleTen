# TripleTen_project 
These are the Projects that I did in Data Science when undergoing training in Tripleten's Data Science Bootcamp.
They involve Data Preprocessing, Analysis and Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Machine Learning for texts, Time Series, Computer Vision, Supervised Learning and 
Unsupervised Learning.
