## Project description

This Project was done for a new-ride sharing company that launched in Chicago, Zuber. As an analyst, my task is to find patterns in the available information. We want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
Working with a database, we will analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.


## Description of the data

A database with info on taxi rides in Chicago:

**neighborhoods** table: data on city neighborhoods

- `name`: name of the neighborhood
- `neighborhood_id`: neighborhood code
