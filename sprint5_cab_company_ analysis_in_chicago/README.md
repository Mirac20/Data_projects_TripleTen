## Project description

This Project was done for a new-ride sharing company that launched in Chicago, Zuber. As an analyst, my task is to find patterns in the available information. We want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
Working with a database, we will analyze data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.


## Description of the data

A database with info on taxi rides in Chicago:

**neighborhoods** table: data on city neighborhoods

- `name`: name of the neighborhood
- `neighborhood_id`: neighborhood code

## General Conclusion

Zuber has its work cutout for itself. It's closest competitors, based on November 2017 rides from Chicago, are: 1) Flash Cab. 2) Taxi Affiliation Services
A few neighborhoods are more popular than others based on average duration of the trip. Loop, Rivernorth are a couple of such dropoff locations that witness a lot of activity.
From 1-7 November, Yellow taxi cabs have done more trips than Blue taxi cabs.
83% of the trips were made in Good weather.
Analysis of the trips on the Saturdays in Novemeber, from Loop to O'Hare, reveals that most of the trips happened on the 1st two Saturdays. Another interesting observation is that distribution of the duration of the trips is uniform between 4 AM - 8 PM; the variations are only seen before 4 AM and after 8 PM.
The hypothesis testing confirms that there is evidence to show that there is a difference in mean trip duration during Bad weather. On average taxis take 6 mins longer to complete a trip during Bad weather.
